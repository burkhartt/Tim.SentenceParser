This module allows you to substring a sentence in a way that makes sense.

Do you ever get worry about trimming down a large paragraph with the fear that the last chopped off word will be a
swear word or something inappropriate? Well, with this module, you don't have to worry about it.

How to use:

Sample sentence: 

var sentence = "The quick, brown fox jumped over the fence.";

1) Trim the sentence:

> sentence.TrimSentence(25);
  "The quick, brown fox"

2) Trim the sentence and add an ellipsis if necessary

> sentence.TrimSentence(25, true);
  "The quick, brown fox..."
